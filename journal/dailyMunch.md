Day 1 (January 24 2024): Today I started the MunchManager app. Progress so far is mostly on getting it started, so I created the repository on Github, started a Trello board with To-Be-Munched, Munching, and Munched as the progress trackers which I thought was hilarious and genius. Also started a Mind Map on MindMeister, have never used this before so we'll see how it'll help me map out the app. I also registered the domain of munchmanager.com on CloudFlare because I have high hopes for this lol. Also made a Figma board for designs a bit later on. I also have my eye on DBVis as the database management system so I can figure out how the relationships are looking. Otherwise I can just go back to using Beekeeper. Also started looking into which coding languages will be best so I can develop this as a mobile app, which I've never made before so that'll be a fun challenge. I also started taking videos summarizing some things in the moment on Instagram, as well as a daily-ish post I'm planning for LinkedIn so I can stay on top of it. This journal will serve as a way to document things as well, but a bit more frankly without trying to sound too professional like LinkedIn or unhinged like on Instagram lol. Also I gotta get rid of my linter so I can keep my journal entries to one line per day lol and it won't give me issues for unit testing later on.
